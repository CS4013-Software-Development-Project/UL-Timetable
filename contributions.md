# Contributions Log – UL Timetabling System

For the actual contribution tracking we should be using a markdown file rather than the excel document provided by the project specs.
This gives us a git-friendly plain-text record that anyone can edit quickly.

At the very end, we can convert between this file with a simple one-line command. We can then import the resulting CSV into the provided .xlsx format.

It is your responsibility to add your contribution to this file.
